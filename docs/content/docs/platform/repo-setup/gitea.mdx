## Set up deploy keys

You can skip this step if your repository is public. Deploy keys are needed when your repository is private. They grant Agin CI read-only access.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Generate a new SSH keypair in the Agin CI Dashboard.

## Set up webhooks

In order for Agin CI to automatically run workflows when events occur, you need to set up webhooks.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Generate a webhook secret in the Agin CI Dashboard. Remember to copy it, as you won't be able to see it again.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Go to your repository settings in your Forgejo or Gitea instance, navigate to **Webhooks** and add a new webhook. Set the payload URL to the URL visible in the Agin CI Dashboard and paste your secret. Remember to set trigger events to **All events**.
