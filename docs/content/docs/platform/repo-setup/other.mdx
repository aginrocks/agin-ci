import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

<Callout>
  If your provider is not supported, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/aginrocks/agin-ci/issues/new) or a [pull request](https://github.com/aginrocks/agin-ci/pulls). In the meantime, you can use it as a Generic Git (Other) provider.
</Callout>

## Set up deploy keys

You can skip this step if your repository is public. Deploy keys are needed when your repository is private. They grant Agin CI read-only access.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Generate a new SSH keypair in the Agin CI Dashboard.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Copy the public key
    ![](/img/repo-setup/github/02.png)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    If your provider supports deploy keys, add the key there. If not, add a standard SSH key to your server or instance. Cloning over HTTPS will be supported soon.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workflow runs

<Callout>
  You'll need to manually run workflows from the CLI or admin panel. Agin CI does not support automatic workflow runs for generic Git providers.
