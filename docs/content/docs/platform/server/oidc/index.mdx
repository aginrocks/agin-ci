## Why OIDC?

Agin CI relies on OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication, as the server does not include a built-in user management system. This means that you need to set up an OIDC provider to handle user authentication.

## Choosing an OIDC Provider

<Callout>
We recommend using a provider that supports refresh tokens. This allows users to stay logged in for a longer period of time without needing to re-authenticate.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Please read this section carefully, as some OIDC providers may not be compatible with Agin CI. Additionally, some providers may require extra configuration steps to function correctly.
</Callout>

You can use many different OIDC providers. You'll find a list of popular OIDC providers below along with guides on how to set them up with Agin CI.

If you're not sure which provider to choose, we recommend starting with Agin Auth, which is an open-source OIDC provider, designed to seamlessly integrate with Agin CI.
